        Zebra finches are a model organism for studying vocal learning and neurobiology. They learn to imitate a highly stereotyped song from a tutor during a critical period early in life, similar to how humans acquire language. Below are two spectrograms, the top being a few seconds of juvenile zebra finch song, and the bottom the adult, crystalized song.

        The primary function of this song is for courting female songbirds - which prefer nicely stereotyped songs, so male zebra finches will practice singing their song alone many times during the day.

        A common experimental paradigm to investigate the learning processes of zebra finch song is to introduce "perceived errors" by playing a short snippet of broadband noise precisely on top of a specific song syllable.
