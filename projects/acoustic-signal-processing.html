  <h1>Acoustic Signal Processing & Feature Extraction</h1>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    High-rate acoustic recordings contain meaningful structure but are dominated by
    noise, nonstationarity, and artifacts. The challenge was to extract stable,
    interpretable features suitable for downstream modeling.
  </p>

  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bandpass filtering and denoising of raw acoustic signals</li>
    <li>Time–frequency representations using STFT and log-spectrograms</li>
    <li>Amplitude normalization and alignment across trials</li>
    <li>Dimensionality reduction using PCA to capture dominant structure</li>
    <li>Validation via reconstruction error and predictive modeling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    The resulting feature representations were significantly more stable than raw
    signals and enabled reliable prediction of neural firing rates using regression
    and tree-based models.
  </p>

  <p>
    PCA revealed low-dimensional structure that aligned with meaningful acoustic
    events, while removing redundant or noisy dimensions.
  </p>

  <h2>Engineering Takeaways</h2>
  <p>
    This project reinforced the importance of validating signal processing assumptions
    before applying machine learning. Careful preprocessing and feature design
    dramatically improved model stability and interpretability.
